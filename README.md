Data structures are generally categorized into two classes: primitive and non-primitive data
structures.
1. Primitive Data Structures:
Primitive data structures are the fundamental data types which are supported by a
programming language. Some basic data types are integer, real, character and Boolean. The
terms ‘data type’, ‘basic data type’ and ‘primitive data type’ are often used interchangeably.
2. Non-Primitive Data Structures:
Non-primitive data structures are those data structures which are created using
primitive data structures. Examples of such data structures include linked lists, stacks, trees,
and graphs. Non-primitive data structures can further be classified into two categories: linear
and non-linear data structures.


Linear and Non-linear Data Structures:
a) Linear Data Structure:
If the elements of a data structure are stored in a linear or sequential order, then it is a
linear data structure. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Linear data
structures can be represented in memory in two different ways. One way is to have to a linear
relationship between elements by means of sequential memory locations. The other way is to
have a linear relationship between elements by means of links. C supports a variety of data
structures.
ARRAYS:
An array is a collection of similar data elements. These data elements have the same
data type. The elements of the array are stored in consecutive memory locations and are
referenced by an index (also known as the subscript).
In C, arrays are declared using the following syntax: type name [size];
For example,
int marks [10];

The above statement declares an array marks that contains 10 elements. In C, the
array index starts from zero. This means that the array marks will contain 10 elements in all.
The first element will be stored in marks [0], second element in marks [1], so on and so forth.
Therefore, the last element, that is the 10th element, will be stored in marks [9].
